![](./demo/Screen%20Shot%202019-09-26%20at%202.39.09%20PM.png)

The main idea of this application is: 
  1. Identifies sprities inside the image and saves them coordinates
  2. Cuts all images using the positions saved
  3. Removes the background of all sprites
  4. Saves all sprites into the output folder
